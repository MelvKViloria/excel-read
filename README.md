# python-sorting

Python Sorting this code includes Bubble, Selection, Insertion sorting.

Bubble - It is a comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

Insertion - Insertion sort involves finding the right place for a given element in a sorted list. So in the beginning, we compare the first two elements and sort them by comparing them. Then we pick the third element and find its proper position among the previous two sorted elements. This way we gradually go on adding more elements to the already sorted list by putting them in their proper position.

Selection - In selection sort, we start by finding the minimum value in a given list and move it to a sorted list. Then we repeat the process for each of the remaining elements in the unsorted list. The next element entering the sorted list is compared with the existing elements and placed at its correct position. So, in the end, all the elements from the unsorted list are sorted.
